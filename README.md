# firefox-numbered-tabs

This userChrome.css file adds visible numbers 1â€“9 to the first eight tabs and the last in a Firefox window. This is helpful when using [keyboard shortcuts to access tabs](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly#w_windows-tabs).

It's based on the work of Reddit user [myfonj](https://www.reddit.com/user/myfonj), found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/7ihf28/numbered_tabs_nightly/). Further discussion of the original work (not incorporated into this project's userChrome.css file) can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/8ruy2d/numbered_tabs_revisited/).
